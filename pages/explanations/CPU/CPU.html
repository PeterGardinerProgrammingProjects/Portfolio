      The CPU
    </h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
      CPU stands for Central Processing Unit. This is where programs are ran.
      To understand the CPU, it is helpful to know what computer programs are 
      and the basics of computer architecture. Computer programs are what 
      <a class="hyperlink" href="../compilers/compilers.html">compilers</a>
      create from source code. This is just a list of simple instructions the
      CPU can understand. Some examples of these fundemental instructions are
      <span class="code-snippet">add</span> and <span class="code-snippet">jmp</span> (jump, which moves where the CPU is executing instructions).
      The CPU can access and modify <a class="hyperlink" href="../RAM/RAM.html">RAM</a>,
      which is where programs live while they are active.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      CPUs run on a cycle determined by a clock, and each tick of the clock,
      the CPU does one step. Some instructions take more steps than others.
      One issue CPUs face is that they can only do one operation at a time 
      (for the most part), so for large amounts of data which require a lot
      of processing, the <a class="hyperlink" href="../GPU/GPU.html">GPU</a>
      is better suited. 
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      For a while now, CPUs have had multiple cores. Cores are effectively smaller
      CPUs which can work together, and having many cores can increase performance
      through multi-threading. Without telling the CPU otherwise, it will only use
      one core to do operations. This is because many programs cannot take advantage
      of multiple cores effectively. For example, a recursive function needs to be
      calculated sequentially, and having cores work in parallel does no good.
      It is also more difficult to design a multi-threaded program because of race
      conditions. These happen when two threads read from or write to the same piece
      of data at the same time. This leads to data being corrupted, which can crash programs.
      For problems which can be parallelized, multi-threading can vastly speed up
      computation time. 
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      The CPU is managed by the operating system (like Microsoft Windows or Apple Mac),
      so when a program trys to use multiple cores, the operating system decides how
      exactly this is done as to not break any other programs using the CPU. If a program
      demanded and received 100% of the CPU, no other programs (not even the operating system)
      could run, which would be bad. This is why the operating system must manage how
      programs use the CPU. One CPU core can seemingly run multiple programs at the same 
      time, but it is really switchingbetween which program it is operating on thousands 
      of times a second.
