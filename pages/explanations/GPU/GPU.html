      The GPU
    </h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
      GPU stands for Graphics Processing Unit. Historically, graphics 
      was about all GPUs did, but now they are used for all kinds of
      parallel computations. The GPU differs from the CPU in one 
      fundemental way: it does calculations in parallel to a much higher
      degree. While the CPU has around 4-8 cores on average, the GPU 
      has thousands of cores. This allows the GPU to complete certain 
      tasks significantly faster.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Parallelizable problems are problems which can be split up into 
      independent paths. An example would be rendering, or creating 
      images to display on a screen. This is because rendering requires
      that the same calculations are applied to each pixel, and pixels 
      are independent from each other. This means that the GPU can 
      assign each core only a few pixels, while the CPU would have to 
      compute each pixel one at a time. The GPU is faster than the CPU 
      for many problems, but most problems are not easily or effectively
      parallelizable. For example, the CPU would be better at calculating 
      the complex trajectory of a satalite traversing the solar system, 
      because each position of the object depends on the last, requiring
      sequential calcuation.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Each thread in a GPU is significantly less powerful than a CPU thread.
      Also, GPUs are more limited at the hardware level. These compromises
      are to maximise the speed of the GPU for the tasks it is designed for.
      GPUs usually only support 16-bit floating point numbers, while CPUs
      support 64-bit. This means that GPUs are much less numerically precise.
