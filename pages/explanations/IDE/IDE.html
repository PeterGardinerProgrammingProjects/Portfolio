      What is an IDE?
    </h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
      IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. An IDE consists of a text editor,
      where code is written, and other features such as 
      <a class="hyperlink" href="../../explanations/compilers/compilers.html">compilers</a>
      , debuggers, and syntax
      highlighters. While IDEs do not usually create these tools, they do create an
      environment that supports them and integrates them seamlessly (hence the name). An 
      example of some IDEs are Visual Studio, CLion, and VS Code*. What is that asterisk 
      doing there? Oh yeah, VS Code is kind of inbetween a text editor and an IDE. It has 
      very few features on its own, but it allows for easy download and use of extentions 
      that bring IDE functionality to the editor. For example, if you wanted to code a C 
      program using VS Code, you would need to download a C extention and bring your own 
      compiler and debugger, while Visual Studio and CLion have that built in.
