      Complex Numbers
    </h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
      What are complex numbers? To understand this, we must first understand imaginary
      numbers. Let's start with the basics, the natural numbers. These are the numbers
      like 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. What is great about these numbers is that we can add them.
      <span class="code-snippet">2 + 3 = 5</span>, <span class="code-snippet">7 + 5 = 12</span>. This is great! What is especially nice is that any two
      natural numbers added together create another natural number. This is also the 
      case for multiplication, like <span class="code-snippet">9 ⨯ 8 = 72</span>. The natural numbers are a set (a group)
      of numbers. The operations of addition and multiplication, if given numbers from
      this set, do not give values outside the set. This means that addition and 
      multiplication are "closed" under the natural numbers. For an operation to be
      closed under a set, it must not leave the set by returning a value not in the set.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      What if we added subtraction? All of the sudden, the natural numbers are not
      enough! If we allow subtraction, what will <span class="code-snippet">4 - 6</span> evaluate to? No such number
      exists, therefore it is impossible. It makes no sense to ask such a question 
      or to create such an operation. Except, not really. It is possible if we extend 
      our idea of what a number is. How about instead of the natural numbers, we use 
      the integers. This set includes negative numbers, so our problem is solved!
      Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are closed under the integers. This is 
      perfect. What's that? You want division? Sure! <span class="code-snippet">32 / 4 = 8</span>. Perfect. <span class="code-snippet">7 / 5 = ...?</span>
      Maybe integers are not enough. Let's add rational numbers! Now we have all the
      operations we could ever want.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      I think you are starting to see a pattern. Whenever we encounter an operation
      that is not closed under our number system, we can expand our definition of a 
      number. How about we add another operation? Exponents seem useful. 
    </p>

    <p class="math-text">
      $$ 7^3 = 343 $$
    </p>

    <p class="math-text">
      $$ 2^\frac{1}{2} = ? $$
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Okay, you got me. Let's add irrational numbers. This would equal the square root
      of two, and the square root is asking the question "what number times itself equals
      this?". 
    </p>

    <p class="math-text">
      $$ \sqrt{-1} = ? $$
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      This isn't hard. We just need to find a number, that when multiplied by itself, equals
      negative one. <span class="code-snippet">1 ⨯ 1 = 1</span>. That's not it. <span class="code-snippet">-1 ⨯ -1 = 1</span>. Hmm... <span class="code-snippet">2 ⨯ 2 = 4</span>, <span class="code-snippet">-2 ⨯ -2 = 4</span>.
      It seems that no such number exists. Therefore, it is impossible. It makes no sense to 
      ask such a question or to create such an operation. Any number times itself is postive,
      not negative. Does this sound familiar? Exponents are not closed under the reals
      (this just means irrationals, rationals, and integers). This means the reals are not
      the full picture. Finally, we reach the definition of an imaginary number:
    </p>

    <p class="math-text">
      $$ i = \sqrt{-1} $$
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      This feels like cheating. We can't just define an answer to exist! The square root
      of negative one is nonsense, right? Nope. Numbers are what we define them to be.
      It made sense to have negative numbers, although you would have a hard time finding
      one in nature. Mathematicians have defined "nonsense" like negative and imaginary
      numbers because they are so useful. They fill in "holes" in our system, keeping it
      closed.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Now we can define complex numbers. Complex numbers are simply numbers with a real 
      and an imaginary component.
    </p>

    <p class="math-text">
      $$ z = a+bi $$
    </p>

    <p class="math-text">
      $$ c = 3.141 - 5i $$
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      The complex number <span class="code-snippet">z</span> has a real part, <span class="code-snippet">a</span>, and an imaginary part, <span class="code-snippet">b ⨯ i</span>. The complex
      number <span class="code-snippet">c</span> is an example of a number in this form. Operations such as addition, subtraction,
      multiplication, division, and exponentiation are well defined for complex numbers.
