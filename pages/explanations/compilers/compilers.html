      What are Compilers?
    </h2>

    <p class="project-paragraph">
      Compilers are what turn human readable source code into instructions
	  a computer can understand and run. Technically a compiler is just one
	  part of this process, but that is not important for now. A compiler
	  follows many steps, and many will be skipped. The first step is 
	  tokenization, the process of breaking down the code into its component
	  pieces. For example, the code 
	  <span class="code-snippet">for(int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++)</span> has 
	  the tokens 
	  <span class="code-snippet">["for", "(", "int", "i", "=", "0", ";",...]</span>
	   (at this point the tokens are just numbers instead of characters). 
	  The compiler then gives these ordered tokens to a parser, which checks
	  the validity of the code. If the parser gets the nonsense tokens 
	  <span class="code-snippet">["for", ")", "0", "while",...]</span>,
    it will give a compiler error, which means the code was invalid. If it
    gets valid tokens, it puts them into groups for the next steps. For 
    example, the code 
    <span class="code-snippet">a + b * c</span>
    should be interpreted as 
    <span class="code-snippet">a + (b * c)</span>
    and not 
    <span class="code-snippet">(a + b) * c</span>. 
    This is what the parser does. There are too many steps to list here,
    but eventually the compiler turns this data into machine instructions 
    which the computer can understand. In fact, compilers do more than 
    just translating, they also optimize. This means that they can 
    analyze how code will run and change it to produce the same result in 
    less steps. For example, this statement can always be ignored: 
    <span class="code-snippet">if (2 + 2 == 5) { DoFunction(); }</span>.
    There is a lot more to compiler optimizations, too much to explain here.
