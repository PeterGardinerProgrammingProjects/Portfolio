      Complex Fractals

      You will need to understand
      <a class="hyperlink" href="../complex_numbers/complex_numbers.html">
        complex numbers

      to understand this explanation. Fractals are mathematical objects which
      have detail at any scale. Usually, if you zoom into a section of a graph 
      or a surface, it approaches a line or a plane. Often, fractals are 
      self-similar, meaning that it contains smaller copies of itself, but this
      is not a requirement. 
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      The Mandelbrot Set is a fractal in the complex plane. It is likely the most
      famous fractal, and it is defined, in part, by this equation.
    </p>

    <p class="math-text">
      $$ z_n=z_{n-1}^2+c $$
    </p>
		
    <p class="paragraph">
      The Mandelbrot Set is a set of complex numbers. This equation is used to
      determine whether or not a particular number, <span class="code-snippet">c</span>, is in the set. It starts
      with <span class="code-snippet">z = 0</span>. Through this recursive 
      function, we can find the next value of z, and the next, and so on. Once
      we have evaluated the function an infinite number of times, we cand decide
      whether or not <span class="code-snippet">c</span> is in the set. If 
      <span class="code-snippet">z</span> grew without bound (reached infinity),
      then <span class="code-snippet">c</span> is not in the Mandelbrot Set.
      Otherwise, it is. Let's see an example with <span class="code-snippet">c = 1 + 0i</span>.
      Remember, <span class="code-snippet">z</span> starts at zero.
    </p>

    <p class="math-text">
      $$ z_1=z_{0}^2+1=1 $$
    </p>

    <p class="math-text">
      $$ z_2=1^2+1=2 $$
    </p>

    <p class="math-text">
      $$ z_3=2^2+1=5 $$
    </p>

    <p class="math-text">
      $$ z_4=5^2+1=26 $$
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      It is clear that <span class="code-snippet">c = 1 + 0i</span> is not
      in the Mandelbrot set, because this value causes <span class="code-snippet">z</span>
      to grow endlessly. There are more complex fractals, like Julia sets,
      which are related to the Mandelbrot Set.
