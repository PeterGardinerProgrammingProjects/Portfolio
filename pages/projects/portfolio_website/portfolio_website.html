      How I Made This Website
    </h2>

    <p class="explanation-disclaimer">
      In this article I mention concepts you may be unfamiliar with.
      Click on the links to see my explanation of them!
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      I have never made a website before. I had no idea where to start. Why do I even
      want to make a website? It started with me wanting to document my programming
      projects, with a bit of math thrown in it as well. First, I looked at services
      like WIX and WordPress, because they allow you to build and host websites using
      their built-in editor. I decided against these options because their options were
      limited, many features required a subscription, and, most importantly, I wanted
      to learn how to create my very own website.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      The first thing I had to do was find out how to host a website. Without hosting,
      no one would be able to access it. I did some research and found that GitHub 
      has website-hosting capabilities. Now I had to learn to make a website. I knew
      that websites use HTML, so I looked for an HTML tutorial. After learning the 
      basics of how a website is structured, I made a GitHub repository to host my 
      website. Then, I connected this repository to VS Code, a
      <a class="hyperlink" href="../../explanations/IDE/IDE.html">text editor/IDE</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Finally, I was set up to start building the site and making changes. Well, almost.
      Each change would take a few minutes to reflect on the real website, so I found a 
      VS Code extention which locally hosts the website on my computer and updates in 
      real time. When I want these changes to take effect, I can push them to the 
      repository. Also, plain HTML is quite boring. This is where CSS comes in. Put 
      simply, HTML tells your browser what elements of a webpage exist and how they are 
      structured relative to each other. CSS tells the browser how to style these 
      elements in various ways.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      After refining the structure of my website, I started working on the design and 
      style. I started with the home page and added buttons to lead the user to 
      projects like this one. Then I added the header at the top of the page. As a
      side note, I have always been annoyed at websites that have a link to the home
      page on the home page itself, so I have avoided that on this website. That is
      what is great about making my own website, I can design it how I want!
