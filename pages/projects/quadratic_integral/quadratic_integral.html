          The General Form of the Integral of Quadratic Polynomials
        </h2>
        
        <p class="explanation-disclaimer">
          In this article I mention concepts you may be unfamiliar with.

        <p class="paragraph">
          This project involves a basic understanding of calculus, and 
          unfortunately I do not have an explanation page available due
          to calculus being such a large topic. With that being said, I 
          found the antiderivative of all square roots quadratic polynomials.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Here is what that means. Quadratic polynomials are polynomials 
          which have a highest degree of 2, and they can be shown by any
          equation which follows the form
        </p>

        <p class="math-text">
          $$ ax^{2} + bx + c $$
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          where a, b, and c are constants.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Finding the antiderivative (integral) of a polynomial is trivial.
          This is because they only consist of constants times a variable
          to an integer power, and each term is summed. It is significantly
          more difficult to find the integral of the square root of quadratic
          polynomials. While for some it is trivial (like the square root of
          x squared), most of these functions create ellipses or hyperbolas.
          These shapes are quite complicated to integrate, and there has to 
          be one formula for them all.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          I was inspired by my calculus 2 class to find this integral. I was
          learning about trigonometric substitution to find integrals similar
          to the general form, but much less complex. Trigonometric substitution
          works by replacing part of the integral with a trigonometric function
          temporarily to apply useful trigonometric identities to simplify
          the integral. To use these techniques, I needed to change the 
          form of the quadratic. I needed it in the form
        </p>

        <p class="math-text">
          $$ A(x-B)^{2} + C $$
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Now I had to convert the original polynomial into this one. This 
          was pretty simple, because the form I needed it in is vertex form.
          The vertex of a polynomial is at the point (B, C) when following 
          vertex form. The vertex is also where the derivative equals zero, so 
          I did some calculus to find that

        <p class="math-text">
          $$ C = -\frac{b^{2}}{4a} + c $$
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Now I could start substituting. Well, almost. I will simplify the 
          interior of the square root.

          Substitution time! I am using hyperbolic trigonometry because it is 
          better defined (no holes) and it has the trigonometric idendity I 
          need.

          That was a lot of math! But now the integral is significantly more 
          simple. What is nice about hyperbolic trigonometry is that its sine
          and cosine functions are just exponetial functions added, and these 
          are very easy to integrate and differentiate. Here we can simplify it.

          This is the answer in terms of theta, but we want it in terms of x.

        <p class="paragraph">
          At this point, we are done. We have found the antiderivative in terms
          of x. But, we can simplify further with the identity
